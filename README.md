The tacocat project shows how to use cats to fold and add many things ...including folding tacos?

Maybe not tacos, but you can apply the Monoid and Foldable typeclass FP patterns to many things. The slides show you how.

This project accompanies the Boston Scala Meetup talk at ~~link to talk~~

The project requires Java 8, Scala 2.12.1 and sbt 0.13.16 environment to run.

### Abstract
Most Java and Scala programmers are familiar with Object Oriented Design Patterns. Functional Programming (FP) patterns attempt to bring similar techniques of providing robust solutions to common problems in software engineering using functional programming techniques. This talk illustrates the usefulness of FP patterns by applying these patterns to two common use cases using the Monoid and Foldable type classes with the Scala cats library.
